Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.


def number_of_ways(msg):
  number = int(msg)
  number_of_digits = 0
  while(number> 0):
    number_of_digits++
    number = number/10
  total_one_digit 
  
  while(number/k > 0):
    k = k*10
    num = number
    while(num> 0):
      if(num % k > 0 ):
        ways++
      num = num/10
      if(num > 9 && num < 27):
        ways++
